## Approach

A reinforcement learning approach was used, where the agent receives rewards for taking correct actions and penalties for undesirable behaviors. The model was trained to navigate the **re:Invent 2018** track from AWS.

### Continuous Action Space Settings

To train the model, we defined the settings for its continuous action space. The action space settings influenced the restrictions the agent had when making decisions.
